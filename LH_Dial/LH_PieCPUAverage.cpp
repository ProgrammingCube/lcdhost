            This class shouldn't be available to the release build as it is much less efficient than the
            usual needle-based dial and, frankly, if this class is available someone will realise they
            can do something clever and cool with it without realising it's absorbing a lot of cycles.
            Basically this class is 95% the same as the CPU Average Dial but nowhere near as efficient.
