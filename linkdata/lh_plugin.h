/**
  These are the entry points for LCDHost plugins. Normal sequence is:

  1.  LCDHost examines the plugin file for build info XML and signature.
  2.  Either the user decides to load the plugin or it's set to auto load
  3.  LCDHost has the operating system load the shared library
  4.  lh_create() is called, requires non-NULL return
  5.  lh_get_object_calltable() is called, requires non-NULL return
  6.  obj_init() is called, returns NULL or error message
    * at this point, barring errors, the plugin is considered loaded
  7.  if defined in calltable, obj_class_list() is called to retrieve list of classes
    * when the user decides to unload the plugin or LCDHost shuts down:
  8.  if defined in calltable, obj_term() is called
  9.  lh_destroy() is called
  10. LCDHost has the operating system unload the shared library

  void *lh_create()
    Create the plugin object and return an opaque reference to it.
    LCDHost will provide this reference when calling other functions
    as the 'ref' parameter. Return NULL on error.

  const lh_object_calltable* lh_get_object_calltable( void *ref )
    Returns a standard object calltable. The function pointers in
    the structure may be NULL except for obj_init() which is required.

  void lh_destroy( void *ref )
    Free resources associated with 'ref'. The shared library is about to be
    removed from memory.

/**
  All plugins must embed an XML document containing build information.
  The document must be readable from the plugin shared library using
  standard binary file I/O. The document must contain the maintag
  <lcdhostplugin>. LCDHost will search the shared library for the
  string '<lcdhostplugin>' and then check to see that it's a correctly
  formed XML document. Encoding must be UTF-8. There must be only one
  copy of the string '<lcdhostplugin>' in the shared library.

  Sample C code to embed the document, copy, paste and modify to suit.
  Note that you could also embed the document using other methods.


  char __lcdhostplugin_xml[] =
  "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>"
  "<lcdhostplugin>"
    "<id>NAME</id>"
    "<rev>" STRINGIZE(REVISION) "</rev>"
    "<api>" STRINGIZE(LH_API_MAJOR) "." STRINGIZE(LH_API_MINOR) "</api>"
    "<ver>" "r" STRINGIZE(REVISION) "</ver>"
    "<versionurl>http://www.linkdata.se/lcdhost/version.php?arch=$ARCH</versionurl>"
    "<author>Johan \"SirReal\" Lindh</author>"

    "ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION"
    "</shortdesc>"
    "<longdesc>"
    "MULTI_LINE_DESCRIPTION"
    "</longdesc>"
  "</lcdhostplugin>";


  'versionurl' is the version information URL. It replaces $ID to <id>,
  $ARCH to the current architecture and $REV to <rev>.
  This URL should return a text/xml document like the following sample:

  <lhver arch="win32" url="http://lcdhost.googlecode.com/files/$ID_$ARCH_R$REV.zip">
   <f id="LH_Text" r="6" />
  </lhver>

  The 'lhver' element contains default attribute values for 'f' elements.
  The 'url' attribute expands the same parameters as the version url.

  A 'f' element may contain the following attributes:
  'id'        The plain filename, without system prefix or suffixes
  'arch'      The architecture (ex, 'win32', 'mac32' or 'lin64d')
  'r'         The revision number
  'url'       The download URL
  'api'       The API versions in the form 'major.minor'

  There may be any number of 'f' elements.

  The document will be cached, so if several plugins refer to the same URL,
  the cached copy will be used. The cache is cleared intermittently.

/**
 You can have LCDHost automatically update a setup item with data from another item.
 The 'link' member, if not NULL, specifies how data linking is handled. The first
 character specifies if it's a data source or a data sink. The rest is a path
 specification separated with slashes. If the first character is an at sign '@'
 then it's a source, with the path defining it's position in the data source tree.
 If the first character is an equal sign '=', then it's a sink, and the path
 specifies which source it wants.

 Examples:
    link = "@/system/Mail count"; // ok, data source providing a mail count
    link = "=/system/Mail count"; // ok, data sink reading the above source
    link = "/system/cpu/count"; // error, missing command character

    You can have LCDHost automatically update a setup item with data
    from another item. All setup items have a link path associated with
    them. If you don't specify a path explicitly, one will be generated
    using the id of the item and it's parents.

    Programatically, you can link any two items. If the data can be
    converted, it will be transferred when updated at the source.

    The UI will show a data linking button for a setup item if
    the LH_FLAG_NOSINK is not set. If clicked, the UI will list
    all setup items that do not have the LH_FLAG_NOSOURCE flag and
    have a compatible mimetype, meaning that the sink may be less
    specialized than the source (as in, you can link 'text/plain'
    to 'text') or identical.

    Both the link paths and mime type text are ASCIIZ. Link path
    separator is a forward slash.

    The maximum length is LH_LINK_SIZE, including NUL.

    \c mime
        Mime type - this is not enforced, currently just used
        to filter sources in user UI. If NULL, a default mime
        type will be selected matching the setup item type.
    \c publish
        When this setup item is changed, notify all items that
        are subscribing to the link path 'publish'.
    \c subscribe
        When the setup items that publish to the link path 'subscribe'

/**
  This structure gives basic information about the class.

  Both the path and name members are UTF-8 encoded and NULL terminated strings.

  \c path is where to place the class in the class list tree. It must be in
  english, and LCDHost may attempt to translate the path items into the users
  language. Example: '/System/Date and time'

  \c id is the internal identifier for this class. It should remain static on
  all platforms/languages. The name of the shared library plus this will be
  used to identify the class uniquely.

  \c name is the text to present to the user as the class' name, for example
  'Clock'. This text should be localized to the users language.

  The width/height members are used to estimate the size of an instance before
  actually creating it. Set to -1 if you have no idea.
